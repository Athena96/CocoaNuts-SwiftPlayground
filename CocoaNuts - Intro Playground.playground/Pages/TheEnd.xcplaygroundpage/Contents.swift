//: Well, you did it, nice job. ☺️
//:
//: This Playground was meant to introduce people with no programming experience to programming in general, as well as to introduce Swift to people who do have some previous programming experience.
//:
//: Hopefully you now have a better idea of what Swift is all about and are motivated to learn even more about Swift and iOS in the future.
//:
//: ## What should I do now?
//:
//: If you want to do some more coding, then I would suggest, in no specific order, the following:
//:
//: • Practice what you learned here in another playground of your own.
//:
//: • Read some more about Swift in the [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309).
//:
//: • Follow a CocoaNuts Demo, and use Swift to make and iOS (or WatchOS or TvOS) [App](https://sites.google.com/site/cocoanutsios/).
//:
//: • Come to a [CocoaNuts Meeting](https://sites.google.com/site/cocoanutsios/)!
