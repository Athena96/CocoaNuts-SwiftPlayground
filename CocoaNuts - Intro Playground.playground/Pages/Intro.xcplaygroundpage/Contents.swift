//: ### What is this Playground for, and what's a Playground?
//:
//: A Playground is a fun way to interactively learn Swift and test out new ideas. The code you type is immediately evaluated and any output is shown on the right hand side of the split screen, which makes for an ideal learning environment.
//:
//: This Playground is meant to introduce programming to complete beginners, as well as provide people who already have some coding experience with the fundamentals of the Swift Language. So, you **don't need any previous coding experience** to benefit from this Playground.
//:
//: ----
//: ### Structure of this Playground
//:
//: It is divided up into multiple pages, and each page covers a specific topic.
//:
//: The Playground was designed using something called the **Parteo Principle** (aka: 80/20 rule): To learn a new skill in the most effective and efficient manner, learn the small (20%) set of core topics that are used the most (80%) in everyday cases. So you won't learn everything, but you will walk away with the things that you will probably be using most.

//:
//: ### How to use this Playground?
//:
//: There are only 3 rules for using this Playground:
//: 1. Space out the sections; don't feel like you have to read through it all in one sitting.
//: 2. Read the sections in the order listed; the material builds on itself.
//: 3. Have fun!

//: ### Why Learn Swift?
//:
//: There are many reasons to learn Swift! As of Feb. 2016 iPhones make up around [40%](http://fortune.com/2016/02/11/apple-iphone-ios-share/) of the smartphone market share, which is a big deal since Swift (along with Objective-C) is the language you use to make iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps. Apple is also really investing a lot in Swift, it has been a main focus since the language was introduced in June 2014. So, learning Swift will be well worth your time.
